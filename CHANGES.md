This is the currently in development version of the ModME. This will be updated with all changes made to other versions.
### Added
- Block users from starting a session if a duplicate key would be created.

### Changed
### Removed

## [1.0.0] - 2015-12-30
### Changed
- Added auto scaling when only a single task, row, or column are in the condition
- Added placeholder into task list to force code to have that section as blank space and pretend a task is there
  - ( this is for scaling reasons).
- Fixed bug where condition page would not allow for saving the configuration and instead saved {} data
  - Was caused by not removing the blanks having a slot to begin with and not removing them when opening the page
