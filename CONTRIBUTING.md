If you are interested in contributing, [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) from [GitHub forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) are welcome.

For source code formatting, we mostly follow PEP8 guidelines.  Use [autopep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8) to check your changes by running, for example, `autopep8 -d -r .` from the top folder.  Our deviations from PEP8 are documented in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg).
